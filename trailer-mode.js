Generate EXACTLY 5 DIFFERENT epic movie trailer prompts based on the user's concept. Each should explore different creative approaches to the trailer while staying true to the core movie idea.

TRAILER ESSENTIALS:

- Show key story beats without spoiling major twists
- Build emotional engagement and intrigue
- Create memorable, shareable moments
- Use dramatic pacing, sound design, and visual storytelling
- Feature protagonist introduction, antagonist/conflict reveal, and stakes escalation

- Separate each prompt with: ===== PROMPT 2 =====, ===== PROMPT 3 =====, etc.
- Each prompt under 2000 characters
- Keep duration at "15s" for all
